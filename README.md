# Coronary Heart :heart: Disease Prediction :mag:
[![forthebadge made-with-python](http://ForTheBadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)](https://www.python.org/)<br>
The project aims to develop **Machine Learning** models to predict the occurence of *Coronary Heart Disease* in the patients. The project uses a dataset of patients for whom a target variable is provided, which states whether the patient is at risk of *Coronary Heart Disease* or Not.<br>
## Dataset Attributes
1. male - Is Patient Male ?
2. age - Age of Patient
3. education - Patient Level of Education
4. currentSmoker - Does the Patient Smoke Currently ?
5. cigsPerDay - Number of Cigarettes Smoked Per Day
6. BPMeds	- Does Patient Take BP Medicines ?
7. prevalentStroke	- Has Patient Had a Stroke before ?
8. prevalentHyp	- Does Patient has Hypertension ?
9. diabetes	- Is Patient Diabetic ?
10. totChol	- Total Cholestrol of Patient
11. sysBP	- Systolic Blood Pressure
12. diaBP	- Diastolic Blood Pressure
13. BMI	- Body Mass Index
14. heartRate	- Heart Rate
15. glucose	- Glucose Level
16. TenYearCHD - **Target Variable**, 0 - No Risk, 1 - Risk of Occurence of CHD<br>
